# Project GreenClean - What is that?  
Open source is not only about software - there are also projects for the development of pharmaceuticals, machines/ devices (3D-printers, e-readers, etc.) and much more. 
So, why not also for household and personal cleaning products?

The goal of all of this is to develop the best possible formulations with a world-wide acting R&D-team!


# Differences between OUR products and commercial ones  

## Team size
Employees cost money, so the research and development teams of companies are usually as small as possible.
Here, we could theoretically be as big as 1000 (or more!) team members due to decentralization!

## Creativity and more refined formulations
Because of the hive mind of our (potentially) big team, as well as the core principles of open source (transparency, reproducibility, open critics, etc.) we can get a way better thought out product than our commercial competitor!  

## Higher quality base ingredients  
For a higher profit margin, companies have to cheap out on their raw materials. They are often more harmful to our health (skin irritation, allergens, etc.) and the environment (bad biodegradability, persistent molecules, etc.), but a tiny bit cheaper.
Most of the prize of a commercial product is defined by
* Greedy CEOs
* Big marketing budget
* Value chain (employees, packaging, machines, etc.)
Because we do it at home, we can invest much more money for our high quality, eco-friendly and in general better raw materials.

# Values  
Companies know exactly, that *their* product is the exact same as the one from their competitor for half the price.
This is why they boost the percieved value of said product by better marketing and useless additives (dyes, fragance, etc.) just to make the product appear as more high-value as it is.  
We, on the other hand, try to keep the formulation stupid-simple (KISS-principle) and also as eco-friendly and harmless as possible.
We don't *have* to keep it 100% bio-based or "natural", but still try our best.
