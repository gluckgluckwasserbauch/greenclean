A liquid detergent for washing your clothes.
It is developed to be used in conjunction with oxygen bleach (Sodium percarbonate + TAED).

# Formula (for 1 l)
- **Soap** (150 g dry/ 300 g wet)
  Function: Reduces foaming, cleaning properties
  Saponified fat
  For the DIY-route, go to the [Soap Calculator](https://soapee.com/calculator).
  The goal is to get a saponification grade of >100%.
  You can also buy the soap already pre-made.
- **Sodium lauryl sulphate** (200 g)
  Function: strong wetting capabilities, removes dirt strongly. Anionic surfactant with extremely high HLB-value.
- **Coco-glucoside** (150 g)
  Function: keeps the dirt in solution (non-ionic Co-surfactant)
- **Sodium citrate**
  Function: binds Calcium and Magnesium ions, which would interfere especially with the soap and make an insoluble grease.
  Recipe for the DIY-route:
    - 210 g Citric acid
    - 180 g Sodium carbonate (washing soda)
  1 g Sodium citrate can bind up to 80 mg Calcium ions.
  I used 250 g Sodium citrate, because I have extremely hard water, but you can reduce it to your liking or even don't use it at all if you want.

  Sodium gluconate would be the better choice, but it isn't as available.
- **Water** (ad 1 l)
  Preferably hot, to dissolve everything. Let it rest over night, it will dissolve, don't worry!

  Next steps for development:
  - Use sulphated rhizinus oil instead of soap: it won't be as affected by hard water as saponified fat is
  - Maybe replace Sodium citrate with Sodium gluconate for better effects.
