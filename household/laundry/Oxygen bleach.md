# Formula (1 kg)  
- **Sodium percarbonate** (950 g)  
  Main ingredient. If used alone, it desintegrates into peroxide (H2O2) with temperatures >60°C.
  The alkalinity helps to dissolve grease/ dirt and other unwanted stuff and amplifies the washing capabilites of our detergent.
- **TAED** (50 g)  
  Activates the bleach to work under 60°C, even room temperature! 
  Sadly, not bio-based, but degrades extremely easily.
